# Slayer Item Check
A plugin to help you remember your slayer items. 
There are 3 types of notifications. A player overlay, a chat notification, and a sound notificaiton. For automatically detecting your current slayer task this plugin relies on the Runelite slayer plugin. If the slayer plugin or Task Infobox are not enabled this plugin will only work in manual mode.

The player overlay will show the required item above your player character. For Instances where multiple items can work, the plugin will check for all the applicable items. For instance if the current task is set to Banshee it will show a pair of earmuffs above the player. If you then obtain a slayer helmet the overlay will disappear because a slayer helmet will provide protection against a Banshee.
