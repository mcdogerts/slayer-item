# Slayer Item Check
A plugin to help you remember your slayer items. 
There are 3 types of notifications. A player overlay, a chat notification, and a sound notificaiton. For automatically detecting your current slayer task this plugin relies on the Runelite slayer plugin. If the slayer plugin or Task Infobox are not enabled this plugin will only work in manual mode.

Here is an example of the player overlay working with the task being manually selected.
